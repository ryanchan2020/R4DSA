# 1.0 ORIGINAL VISUALIZATION


![](img/1. Original Visualization.png) 

The above chart shows a visualization depicting merchandising trade of Singapore’s trading partners from 2011-2020. The visualization comes from the Department of Statistics Singapore International Trade infographic page at [https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/singapore-international-trade), and the dataset can be downloaded from the under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by [Region/Market section](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data) under ‘Download all in Excel’.

Before we analyse the visualization, it is important to gain a clear understanding of the context of the visualization and the data it represents.

* Data represents Singapore’s trade values (Exports and Imports) with its top 10 trading partners, in year 2020.
* Visualization utilizes a scatterplot chart as the foundation, with export value on the X-axis and import value on the Y-axis. The size of each bubble / point indicates the total trade volume.

# 2.0 CRITIQUE OF VISUALIZATION
## 2.1 Clarity

1. Using sized bubbles as the data points for a scatterplot chart makes it very hard for the user to accurately identify the exact origin point, any user who wants to estimate the export and import values will find it hard to do so. Furthermore, what is the point of assigning the total trade volume to size of the bubble, when it is intuitively clear that any point nearer to the top right of the chart will be huge and points nearer to the bottom left will be small?

2. The chart only states the total trade amount for each trading partner, there is no clear labelling or indication of the exact export and import values.

3. When mouse is hovered over a trading partner, that corresponding bubble selection will move to be on the front most panel, and potentially obscure the other bubbles and their trade amounts. This is not friendly to a user who would like to compare two partners’ trade amounts.

## 2.2 Aesthetics

1. The size of each bubble is too huge and unnecessary, and only serves to contribute to the obscuring problem mentioned above. 

2. There is a default overlay position where if left untouched some bubbles are always on top of other bubbles. However, when a mouse is hovered over a particular bubble the bubble will come to the front, only for it disappear to the back again once the mouse has left the bubble. This can be an eyesore for a user who is having to move his / her mouse around the chart and constantly seeing bubbles ‘popping’ and ‘disappearing’ in quick fashion.

3. The use of colours seem to be arbitrary in this chart, there is no clear function that each colours serves except to differentiate each country. This is never good practice, to implement a functionality that does not help the user in any way in his / her analysis of the data.


# 3.0 Proposed Alternative Design

![](img/2. Proposed Alternative.jpg) 

Two charts are introduced.

1. The chart on the left retains the foundation build of the original visualization, with several tweaks. 

    + It is still a scatterplot with each dot representing the export and import values for each trading partner. 
    + The size function from the original visualization are discarded, so the chart will not be so convoluted.
    + A 45-degree reference line is created such that any point above the line is a Net Importer and any point below the line is a Net Exporter.
    + Two colours are introduced, green for partners that are net exporters and red for partners that are net importers.
    + Tooltips will include useful information such as total trade volume, whether partner is a net exporter or importer, net (export / import) trade value and export / import values.
    
2. The chart on the right is a combination of bar charts.

    + Each row on the chart represents a trading partner.
    + For each row, the partner’s import value will be shown as a reversed horizontal bar on the left, and export value as a normal horizontal bar on the right.
    + Within the bars of each row, a corresponding net trade value will be shown (i.e. if partner is a net exporter, a smaller bar representing the net export trade value will appear within the export bar with a label to indicate the net trade value)
    + Net exporters will have their export bars highlighted in green, while net importers will have their import bars highlighted in red.
    + Tooltips will include useful information such as total trade volume, whether partner is a net exporter or importer, their net exporter / importer rank, net (export / import) trade value and export / import values.
    
3. Several controls will be utilized for the user to interact with the visualization

    + A year slider will allow user to scroll through the data by year
    + A country filter will allow user to select only specific partners he / she wants to see, or to exclude certain specific partners
    + ‘Top N Partners’ allows typed-in integers that will limit both charts to showing a limited amount of countries, based on the selected ranking type
    + ‘Rank By’ is a parameter allowing user to select Top N Partners based on the following rank types: Total Trade, Net Exporter and Net Importer. This function will also change the order of partners that the right chart displays, with the highest value partner on top.


# 4.0 DATA PREPARATION

The data was first cleaned and prepared using Tableau Prep Builder and then loaded into and visualized using Tableau.

## 4.1 Importing Data

1. Create a connection to the data source.

2. Drag the tables (T1 and T2) to edit into the canvas to start their respective flows. From this point onwards, both tables shall be handled in the same manner until the moment they are joined.

3. Tick the ‘Use Data Interpreter’ check box.

![](img/3. Importing Data.JPG){width=60%}

4. Tableau’s Data Interpreter will try its best to figure out the underlying table structure in each worksheet. The result of cleaning with Data Interpreter are as follows:

**Original**

![](img/4. Original Before Data Interpreter.jpg)

**After Data Interpreter is Used**

![](img/5. After Data Interpreter.jpg)

## 4.2 Pivoting Data

1. Click on the ‘+’ sign beside the table and select ‘Pivot’
  
2. On the left panel, select all fields except ‘Subject: Merchandise Trade’ and drag them to the ‘Pivoted Fields’ pane.

![](img/6. Pivoting Data.JPG){width=70%}

3. After pivoting the relevant fields, add another step to ‘clean’ data.

![](img/7. Add Clean Step.JPG){width=60%}

## 4.3 Cleaning Data

1. Rename the fields accordingly

2. Create a calculated field to derive the actual value of each row

![](img/8. Rename and Calculate Import.JPG)

3. Use the filter function to exclude continents

![](img/9. Exclude Continents.jpg)




4. Convert the ‘Year Month’ field into a date time format

![](img/10. Convert to DateTime.jpg)



5. Filter for the time period we want.

![](img/11. Filter Time Period.jpg)




## 4.4 Joining Tables

1. Add a new step to join the two cleaned tables.
2. Under settings, apply two join clauses: Period and Country. Change the join type to ‘Right’ (i.e. ensure the entire ‘Clean 1’ circle is shaded in the venn diagram. Output should be a total of 13,320 values.
3. Remove duplicated fields

![](img/12. Remove Duplicate.JPG)


4.	For both Export and Import values, use the function ZN() to convert null values to 0.


![](img/13. ZN function.jpg)


5. Create an aggregate step.

    a. Drag ‘Period’ and ‘Country’ to the Grouped Fields, and ‘Export’ and ‘Import’ to the Aggregated Fields.


![](img/14. Aggregate.jpg)




    b.	Under the Period field in the Grouped Fields, convert dates to year number
    
![](img/15. Convert to year.JPG)





    c.	In the top left hand corner of the Period field, click the icon and change the data type to ‘Date’.
    
![](img/16. Change to Date Type.jpg){width=60%}





## 4.5 Run Output Flow

1.	Add an Output step and click ‘Run Flow’ to save the data as a Tableau Data Extract (.hyper)

# 6. MAJOR OBSERVATIONS

1.	From 2011 to 2012, Malaysia was Singapore’s top trading partner, with total trade volumes of S$113 billion and S$115 billion respectively.  However, from 2013 onwards, we see that Mainland China took over the top spot as Singapore’s top trading partner, growing from a trade volume of S$116 billion to a record high of S$137 billion in 2019, before dipping slightly to S$136 billion in 2020.

![](img/67. Obs 1.JPG)




2.	Interestingly, over the last 10 years Hong Kong has been consistently a top importer of Singapore’s goods and services. Singapore has managed to maintain a steady trade surplus of between S$50-60 billion during this period, never once falling outside this range.


![](img/68. Obs 2.JPG)



3.	Singapore has consistently been a high importer of goods and services from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and United States. In the last 10 years, these 3 countries have managed to be in the Top 5 Net Importer rankings in all but one year (Taiwan in 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2019 and United States in 2020).
